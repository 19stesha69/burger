### *Eat-Da-Burger* is a restaurant app that allows the user to create, and devour, the burgers of their choosing. It uses the Model-View-Controller architecture pattern, Node and MySQL (to query and route data), and Handlebars to generate HTML.

# Instructions
1. The *Eat-Da-Burger* page displays for the user a series of numbered buttons displaying the names of previously created and devoured burgers. There is a text box and submit button for creating a new burger.
